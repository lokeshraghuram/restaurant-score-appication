= Restaurant Scoring Service

This is a backend service which provides CRUD APIs for restaurant scoring

== How to launch the service
=== Pre-requisites
==== Mandatory
- Java 11, Maven
- PostgreSQL

==== Optional
- Jaeger. Set `opentracing.jaeger.enabled=false` for enabling traces

Once pre-requisites are in place, use the IDE of your choice and run the service using `mvn spring-boot:run`

== Endpoints

After application is launched, hit the url - http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui/index.html. A window pops up requesting for credentials.
Use "public" as username and password. You should see Open Api definition like below

Role based authentication is described in <<Security,security>> section

== Database Schema

Two tables are used. For scripts, refer <<..db-scripts/DDL.sql#,here>>

1. restaurant_data: This is created as per LIVES version 2.0.
Primary key is combination of *business_id, inspection_id and violation_id*

2. restaurant_status: This table holds the inspection status and the last inspection date of each business id

== Security

Following users are added to InMemoryUserDetailsManager

- Inspector: Has authorities to `scope:read` and `scope:write`. Username and password is *inspector*
- Public: Has authorities to `scope:read` only. Username and password is *public*

Reason for creating above roles is to restrict the use of POST, PUT and DELETE methods to only inspectors

In Postman, under Authorization, choose `Basic Auth`. Type username and password depending on the endpoint you want to test.
`inspector` credentials works for all URLs whereas `public` endpoint works only for `GET` URLs
